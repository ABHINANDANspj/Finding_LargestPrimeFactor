# Finding_LargestPrimeFactor
The prime factors of 13195 are 5,7,13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of a given number ? 


if we have a 10 then the largest prime factor will be 5 ! so ,here i will discuss algorithm to solve a such type of problem : 
step 1 : intialize x // which will be long long integer 
step 2 :start i=2;// i will be long long integer in a for loop i=2 := i*i<=x;i++;
step 3 : make a condition for a even number 
          a) := if it is even then divide x=x/i;
          b) := print the value x;
 step 4 :  if it is odd number number itself be an odd number !
